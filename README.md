- 👋 Hi, I’m @EngineerAlexander
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Algorithms, automation, cryptocurrencies, computer vision, machine learning, trading, and realtime applications of these.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... TCL, C++ at work, Python libraries at home
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Cryptocurrency and trading codebases.
- 📫 How to reach me ... https://www.bijancreates.com

I obtained my degree in Mechanical Engineering at University of California, San Diego in 2020 where I discovered a love for computer science and open-source projects. Shortly thereafter, I fell down the rabbit-hole of crypto and all it has to offer for humanity.


I've done stints at:
-UCSD Medically Advanced Devices Laboratory
-developing a computer vision system in ImageJ and MATALB to automatically analyze hundreds of videos of microfluidic droplet ejection for research pertaining to a new type of 3D-printing technology that features a buildplate above the printing material.

-HP Inc.
-As a microfluidic computer vision engineer working with Python and Java to create an automated code-pipeline and internal library for analyzing thousands of microfluidic flow videos.

-Northrop Grumman
-As a space dynamics engineer working on the James Webb Space Telescope, developing Nastran-MATLAB pipelines in Linux for computationally intensive physics simulations based on space vehicle lifetime events.

-Boeing
-As a software engineer working with Linux, C++, TCL to verify software running onboard satellites.
